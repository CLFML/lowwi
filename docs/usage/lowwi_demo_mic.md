# LOWWI demo microphone
The Lowwi microphone Demo that comes with this library demonstrates the wakeword api of this library by letting you test it with your microphone. You can now trigger the "Hey mycroft" wakeword, by screaming it at your screen! Watch out for any house mates, you might get strange looks. 

## Building and compiling
To build and run this example you need all the prerequisites you would normally need to build the library. As these steps differ a lot between platforms/oses, a guide for the three most used platforms was made:

- [Windows Guide](build_environment/usage_with_windows.md)
- [Mac Os Guide](build_environment/usage_with_mac.md)
- [Linux Guide](build_environment/usage_with_linux.md)
